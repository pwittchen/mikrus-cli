# mikrus CLI

`mikrus` is a Rust CLI for managing [mikr.us](https://mikr.us/) VPS servers via
the [mikr.us API](https://api.mikr.us/). Use it whenever the user wants to
inspect or operate on their mikr.us VPS.

## Invocation

```
mikrus [PROFILE] [--srv <SRV>] [--key <KEY>] [--json] <COMMAND>
```

Append `--json` when you need raw JSON for programmatic parsing instead of
formatted text.

## Credential resolution

Credentials are resolved in this order (highest first):

1. `--srv`/`--key` flags, or `MIKRUS_SRV`/`MIKRUS_KEY` env vars
2. Named profile from `~/.mikrus` passed as first positional arg
   (`mikrus marek245 info`)
3. Default profile — the one marked `default = true` in `~/.mikrus`, or the
   first one when nothing is marked (a single entry is therefore auto-selected)

If you are not sure which profile to use, run `mikrus ctx` first — it lists the
configured servers and says which one is the default. `mikrus config` adds the
config file paths and currently active credentials. When the config file has
multiple profiles and the user hasn't specified one, ask which profile to
target rather than relying on the default.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `info` | Server information |
| `servers` | List all user servers |
| `restart` | Restart the server |
| `logs [ID]` | Log entries (optional specific ID) |
| `logs short` | Condensed one-line log summary (aligned columns, 100 char cap) |
| `amfetamina` | Performance boost |
| `db` | Database credentials |
| `exec <CMD>` | Run a shell command on the server |
| `stats` | Disk / memory / uptime stats |
| `stats short` | Shortcut for `stats --truncate 100` |
| `stats --truncate <N>` | Truncate long lines at N chars (0 = no truncation) |
| `ports` | TCP / UDP ports |
| `cloud` | Cloud services & stats |
| `domain <PORT> [DOMAIN]` | Assign domain to a port — omit DOMAIN for auto-assignment. Available: `*.tojest.dev`, `*.bieda.it`, `*.toadres.pl`, `*.byst.re` |
| `config` | Show config path, profiles, active credentials |
| `ctx` | List configured servers (project-local `.mikrus` first) and show the default one |
| `ctx switch [NAME]` | Make another server the default, saved as `default = true` in the config file. Without NAME it opens an arrow-key menu that needs a terminal — always pass NAME when running it yourself. |
| `ssh` | SSH into the server (uses optional `ssh` field from the active profile) |
| `status` | mikr.us infrastructure status from `status.mikr.us` — colored dots per monitor. Auto-detects the user's hosting server by reading the `<h1>` of `<srv>.mikrus.xyz`, prints a `Your server: srvNN.mikr.us (<user_srv>)` header, and marks the matching monitor with `→`. Status page itself needs no auth; the host lookup uses no credentials either. |
| `status short` | One line per matched user server (e.g. `● srv30  up`); skips the full grid. Best when the user just wants to know if their VPS is up. |

## SSH

`mikrus ssh` does **not** call the API. It reads the `ssh` string from the
active profile in `~/.mikrus` and shells it out via `sh -c`, so any flags,
ports, or identity files embedded in that string are honored. If the profile
has no `ssh` field, the command errors with instructions to add one.

## Tips for the assistant

- Prefer `--json` when you need to extract a specific field or feed the output
  into further processing.
- `stats short` / `logs short` / `status short` are usually the right default
  for humans — they're easier to read than the full output. Reach for
  `status short` when the user just wants a yes/no answer about their VPS.
- Destructive-ish commands (`restart`, `domain`, `exec`) affect the live VPS.
  Confirm with the user before running them unless the user has just asked for
  exactly that action.
- `mikrus` with no subcommand prints the logo and `--help`; don't rely on this
  for scripting.
- Project docs: see `README.md` at the repo root for installation and the full
  config-file schema.
